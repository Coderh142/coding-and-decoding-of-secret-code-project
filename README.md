# coding-and-decoding-of-secret-code-project
    *********** This code is in PYTHON language ***********

step 1:
     For coding*
                 -> Write anything which is greater than 3 it converts that into secret code.
                 -> But if what you have write is less than 3 characters it simply resverse that. 
      
step 2:
      For decoding*
                   -> First of all you have to copy secret code what you have got and past that it will decode that for you.
                   -> But if code is less than 3 characters it will simply reverse it for you.
